Open SMR_Calculator and follow the steps.

==============================================================================================================	
SMR_Calculator

	This tool was designed to compare like part numbers SMR codes and NSNs. Often SMR codes are different
	and that is okay. This will also check for SMR codes that are not valid for this program.
	Pressing 0 will enable to tell the computer which are valid. Initially it is set up for a 
	previous program, so not much editing would be necessary. If it is, then I have started setting
	up in the SMR folder a place to edit it for each program. Not yet programmed in.

==============================================================================================================
CSV folder 

	Incldes csv files with the differences in SMR codes and NSNs and invalide SMR codes

==============================================================================================================
TEXT folder

	Includes a text file with all the SMR codes for each PCCN, program.

==============================================================================================================
SMR folder

	Includes All and filtered SMR codes. Not program specific

	Includes some future ideas too to make program specific.

==============================================================================================================
lib folder

	The following files are in the lib folder. The must be used through the sMR_Calculater due to 
		file struture.

	SMR_comparison
		
		This tool compares the SMR codes and NSNs to each part number and the filtered SMR codes

	Valid_SMR_codes

		This tool creates the filtered set of SMR codes and all possible SMR codes and puts them
			in the SMR folder
