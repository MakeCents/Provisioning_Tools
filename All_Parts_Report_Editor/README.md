All_Parts_Report_Editor
=======================

Excel vba editor/trainer for 036 Reports

Open, write, edit, filter, and develop 036 reports and technical manuals in Microsoft Word and SGML.

Excel VBA 2007.

Scope:
The purpose of this tool is to consolodate provisioning and manual development efforst into a single source development enviroment which will create both the provisioning data and the manuals unbeknownst to either the provisioner nor the technical writer as they are using the area of this tool that they understand.

This tool is desinged to work with some type of version control, like Tortoise SVN, since there is no record keeping or undo buttons.

The functions in this tool are designed to be dynamic and update as you change things without you having to think about it. If an assembly is changed, then it should change it everywhere. If a part is deleted, next higher assemblies, same as PLISNs, and quantities should all update without you making it. At least I am trying to do this.
