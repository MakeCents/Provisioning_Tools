Word:
	This will be designed to be able to open Word table templates and save over or create files for referencing
		to main documents.
	
	The files will need set up initally, not the figures, but the files that reference the figures, i.e. group
		names and numbers and the outline to reference to the figures.

SGML:
	Figure tables will be written from Excel.

	I have SGML tools in the existing PMD set that will be incorporated into All_Parts after it is working that
		will automate the file referencing and set up, but for now they will be manually set up.
